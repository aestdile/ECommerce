I am only now gradually starting to get involved in real projects, I have no experience, so a new job would be very suitable for me to develop my knowledge and skills, gain experience. Currently, participating in a practical project or trying myself in a company, gaining new knowledge, skills and experience will serve as a great foundation for me to start my programming career. I would like to ask you if you have any jobs for those who are just starting out in the programming field, let me know about them, I want to grow faster in this field, create new Start Up projects, work in top companies in the world and contribute to the widespread spread of modern developments in other countries.
